Developers are a discerning bunch. At their core, they value **utility** above all else. If your product doesn't solve a real problem they face, it won't matter how sleek or user-friendly it is. Developers are problem-solvers by nature; they appreciate tools that help them build faster, debug easier, or manage complexity. It has to be immediately useful.

Once utility is established, **ergonomics** become paramount. Developers spend hours immersed in their tools, so the way a tool feels can significantly impact their productivity. Ergonomics is about creating an intuitive experience that aligns with their existing workflow and feels familiar. Speed is a feature. A tool that anticipates needs and reduces friction becomes an extension of their process, allowing them to focus on other things.

**Aesthetics**, while less critical, still hold weight. A clean, uncluttered interface makes prolonged use more enjoyable. But for many successful developer tools, functionality takes precedence. Developers prefer form that follows function. They appreciate designs that highlight usability rather than distract with unnecessary embellishments. Subtlety goes a long way.

**Price** is always a significant consideration. With a many of open source alternatives available and the skills to build custom solutions themselves, developers are cautious about where they invest their money and assume vendor risk. Commercial developer products must offer clear, tangible benefits to justify this. Although some developers are truly unwilling to pay, all need a compelling reason to do so. In general, it seems developers are more okay with paying for hardware and networked services rather than for software. Time saved, ongoing efficiency gained, or problems solved can tip the scales.

**Incremental adoption** is key. Developers are often entrenched in complex systems, and the prospect of overhauling their setup for a new tool is unappealing. They prefer solutions that can be adopted gradually and play well with their existing environment and language ecosystem.

When communicating with developers, **be direct**. Articulate what your product does and how it benefits them. Onboarding should be straightforward and often requires at least one step that demonstrates commitment, perhaps a quick setup script or a sample project.

But be prepared: despite your best efforts, it's normal for many developers to try it once and never return: window-shopping. That's just how it works.
