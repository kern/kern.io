Technical founders often focus intensely on their unique technical insight, convinced it's the key to disrupting incumbents. But superior technology alone rarely topples giants. What's equally crucial is a parallel market or channel insight: understanding how to navigate the existing landscape to reach and persuade customers in the first place.

Without this, startups struggle to overcome switching costs and outmaneuver entrenched competitors. This begs the question: is what you're offering a product or just a feature that could be replicated by larger providers?

Startups require dual insights about technology and how it is brought to market. Ask what these unique insights are, and let it become the company identity. This fusion of technical prowess and market understanding leads to genuine breakthroughs.
